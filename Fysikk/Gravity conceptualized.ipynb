    "If you are encapsuled in a closed environment that *accelerates* at a rate different from that of gravity, you will *feel* this as either weightlessness or as being pushed down. What really happens is not a change in gravity, but rather that the body/element you are encapsuled in changes velocity (i.e accelerates) at a greater rate than the gravitational acceleration your body has towards the floor.\n",

    "When an elevator goes upwards, the force upwards on the elevator is greater than the force that is keeping it on the ground. The force that keeps it on the ground is equal to the $\\vec{F}_{elevator} + \\vec{F}_{man}$. When the force is applied upward on the elevator, the elevator and the man inside changes velocity upwards. Even though"
